= Wordpress

== Setup

My current Wordpress setup runs:

* An Apache server,
with a local source directory added as _bind mount_.
* A MySQL server,
with its database stored on a Docker volume.
* A PhpMyAdmin server,
to manage the database(s).

cloud project {
  component site
  component pma
  database db
  storage wpdb as "docker\nvolume"
  site -- db
  pma -- db
  db - wpdb
}
folder local as "local directory"
site <- local: bind mount
----

Configuration remarks:

* You need to set your own local user and group id in `.env`.
* Also, the `.env` file has hard-coded values
for WORDPRESS_HOME and WORDPRESS_SITEURL,
using `http://localhost` as the server.
* For this to work, the application server
in `docker-compose.yml` has the setting:
+
[source,yaml]
....
    extra_hosts:
      - localhost:host-gateway
....
