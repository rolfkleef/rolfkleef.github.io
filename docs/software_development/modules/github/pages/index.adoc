== Issue labels

We use a Github Action to add a default set of issue labels to a repository.
These default labels are partly based on the Flow Framework, and partly on standard Github labels.

We use the https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-label-manager-action[Issue Label Manager Action] for this.
The example action triggers on each _issues_ event, which seems a bit too frequent.
Instead, we trigger on a _label_ event:
whenever a change is made to the labels, the defaults are added.

A typical approach would be:

. Create the repository on Github
. Add the Github Action configuration (see the files below) and push
. Go to the issue labels, and remove an unneccessary label.
. The action should trigger, and the default labels should appear.
