= Terminal recording

Create SVG images to show interaction with a command line terminal.

This is based on two tools.

== asciinema

https://asciinema.org[asciinema^] lets you record interaction in a terminal.

The recorded session can be saved as local JSON file, and replayed in the terminal.

  $ asciinema rec my-recording.json
  
  $ asciinema play my-recording.json

The file can be uploaded to the asciinema server for sharing and embedding.

== svg-term-cli

https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term-cli[svg-term-cli^] can translate an asciinema file into an SVG image.

This can be an uploaded recording, or a local file.

  $ svg-term --in my-recording.json --out my-recording.svg

The SVG file can be included in the documentation.
