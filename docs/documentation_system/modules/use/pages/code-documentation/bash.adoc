= Bash shell scripts

== Multiline comments

Bash-like shells (including zsh) allow multiline comments in the form:

[source, bash]
----
: ' # <1>
comments
comments
' # <2>
----
<1> Start of multiline comment. This can include content on the same line.
<2> End of multiline comment.
The quote needs to be at the start of the line.
Additional comments can be added on the same line.
