= Admonition and issue use 

The Asciidoc documentation gives guidance on _how_ to write different types of semantic content.
This section attempts to offer guidance on _when_ to use specific elements.

== Admonitions

The Asciidoc documentation does explain the difference between _Caution_ and _Warning_.
We expand on that, inspired by other documentation guidelines.
