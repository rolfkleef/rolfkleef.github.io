The starting point is to follow the Docs as code approach to keep source code and documentation close together, and to use standard developer tools to support document writing. The documentation covers the following users and systems. Figure 1. Documentation system overview Editor An editor can also be a developer, and contributes content sources (text, diagrams). The choice of tools to edit and manage content should be flexible. Content sources Implementation-specific, detailed documentation should live close to, or even inside source code or configuration files. Higher-level decisions and architectures can live in separate documentation sections. Sources are typically spread over multiple locations and repositories, and may cover multiple versions of a part of the documentation. Publisher The publisher triggers an update of the website by generating a new version and publishing this version. This may be part of an automated update system. The publisher also manages the styling of the output via the website generator system. This way, the same content sources could be re-used for different documentation websites. Website generator The website generator combines sources from multiple repositories and versions into a single website. The website can be published as a static website, to any suitable platform. Preferably, it’s also possible to generate other formats of documentation, such as PDF or EPUB.","title":"Documentation system","component":"documentation_system","version":"","name":"index","url":"/documentation_system/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What the documentation system covers","hash":"documentation-system-overview","id":1},{"text":"Key roles and subsystems","hash":"_key_roles_and_subsystems","id":2}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"Each content source repository will typically define a single component. It is possible to use multiple repositories for a single component. If a repository contains documentation for only one component, it is sufficient to use for instance the /docs/ directory as the root of a component. In many cases, however, we have multiple components under the /docs/ directory. Each of these will have its own antora.yml to define the component to which it contributes. For instance, it is possible to add private documentation to a section or module in two ways. Each has its own workflow. I’m not sure yet which version works best, or whether it depends on the context of use. Main problem with \"injection\" is that there can only be one list of navigation docs. It would require separate \"public\" and \"private\" versions of the component definition, with their own nav lists. Work with a private branch, and use this to add private documentation to the existing documentation. This makes the documentation structure easier to manage, and it is possible to add private notes to public pages. It would benefit from clearly marking the private portions, especially in the sources. It requires additional work to port updates of public documentation into the public branch. It may be best suited for deployment-specific branches, to create deployment-specific documentation that includes configuration code. Work with a separate folder for additional private documentation. This works for modules and pages. It is not possible to add private notes to existing pages. It keeps the private sections clearly separated from public sources, reducing the chances of accidental publishing. It would also benefit from clearly marking the private portions, but more for the front-end.

Asciidoc has macros to include STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) equations and formulas. When STEM is \"activated\" on a page, it will include MathJax for client-side rendering of this content. However, Antora does not include MathJax on STEM-enabled pages. One way to solve this, is to add a slightly customised solution: Add a page attribute like page-stem instead of stem. Adapt the UI to include MathJax for pages with this attribute. We have chosen a different way: Include the @djencks/asciidoctor-mathjax package. Add it as extension to generate inline SVG rendering when producing the site. The benefit is that this is preserves the Asciidoc STEM macro behaviour. It also keeps the published pages a little lighter. The downside is that it is not possible to copy an equation or formula from the page. Neither the source nor the image itself is selectable. Client-side rendering works better for accessibility. Using standard Asciidoc has priority now. [1] We expect that either Antora or the extension will be updated at some point. Asciidoc seems to favour Asciimath over TeX and LaTeX as default format. It is possible to mix both on a page. It appears that TeX/LaTeX is more widely used in science. Optionally activate STEM as attribute in the page header. The extension does not require this attribute but will always process STEM blocks. = Page title :stem: (1) 1 Default value is asciimath, can also be latexmath. Then add either inline or block elements. This is inline stem:[sqrt(4) = 2]. It can be with explicit format choice: latexmath:[C = \\alpha + \\beta Y^{\\gamma} + \\epsilon]. It can also be put in a block, which will be centered: [stem] ++++ [[a,b],[c,d]]((n),(k)) sqrt(4) = 2 sqrt(9) = 3 ++++ This is inline . It can be with explicit format choice: . It can also be put in a block, which will be centered: Not all latexmath blocks seem to work yet: [latexmath] ++++ \\begin{align*} 1 + 2 &= 3\\\\ 1 &= 3 - 2 \\end{align*} ++++ is rendered as Unknown environment 'align*' 1. A third way is to consider Katex instead of MathJax, but this would also stray away from standard Asciidoc for now.","title":"MathJax","component":"documentation_system","version":"","name":"mathjax","url":"/documentation_system/tools/mathjax.html","titles":[{"text":"Background","hash":"_background","id":1},{"text":"Using STEM (summary)","hash":"_using_stem_summary","id":2}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"Create SVG images to show interaction with a command line terminal.

This is a works-for-me solution that could eventually be replaced by an Asciidoc macro, an Antora pipeline component, and/or a bibtex-based approach, to be more in line with common practice. This version does not build a bibliography based on in-text references, it just creates a list as HTML file to be included. There is no way to cross reference or link between the text and a specific reference. Figure 1. Zotero subsystem overview The editor performs a few tasks. Organise references in Zotero Add Zotero lookup details to the content Run the content helper Include the reference list in a page Zotero lets you organise references in collections and label them with tags. Both can be used to later retrieve a set of references from Zotero. We use a collection for each page. [1] It is possible to move collections around in Zotero without changing their identifier. This decouples the exact hierarchy and organisation of collections in Zotero from the documentation pages. Collections can be part of a personal library or a group library. Figure 2. Current organisation of collections in Zotero Each content component can have a file called zotero in the same folder as the antora.yml file. This file contains a list of reference lists to generate.

The collection id can be found in the web address when visiting the collection online. Also, the Zutilo addon offers a way to create links to a collection in either the Zotero application or the Zotero website for your library. This is an alternative option to find the collection id. The content helper get-zoteros is a script that can be run in a component folder. See below for the script itself. It will process the zoteros file and use the Zotero API to do two retrievals: Get an HTML-formatted list of references using a specified CSL file. [2] Add the same list formatted as COinS, to let readers quickly add the references to their own reference manager. [3] The resulting HTML file is stored in the partials folder of a module. This partial file is also included in version control, so the helper only needs to be run when references have changed. The reference list can be added to a page with a simple Asciidoc include statement in a pass-through block.

With a bit of planning and templating, it is even possible to combine multiple repositories of an organisation into a single website. For more complex content or websites, however, it seems necessary to create bespoke tooling. Asciidoc claims to be a richer markup language, and Antora standardises how to organise multiple sources and versions. Therefore I compared both stacks, looking at the markup languages, the organisation of sources, and some experiences. Table 1. Creating documentation pages Stack Markdown Asciidoc Markup Format Both have a simple text-based format that is are very suitable for version control. Specifics There is no single Markdown standard. Each variation adds features in their own way. [1] It is turning into an open standard, and supposedly semantically equivalent to DITA, and offers many useful standard features. The syntax takes a bit more time to get used to. Document meta data Common practice is to include YAML-based \"front matter\" to specify meta data. Documents have a title, followed by meta data attributes. Document features Markdown is deliberately limited to keep it simple. There are extensions to include the ability to work with tables or formulas. It is possible to include CSS classes, but these will not be shown in a WYSIWYG editor. Asciidoc supports more complex markup, such as footnotes, (nested) tables, and semantic markup, for instance for admonitions. HTML support Both formats allow including HTML code for further layout. In Markdown, this can be directly included. In Asciidoc, this needs to be put in a pass-thru block. Editor support Text editing Most editors offer Markdown and Asciidoc plugins with a \"preview\" screen or tab to see the visual result. Users edit the raw text markup, with the help of syntax highlighting. In-place WYSIWYG editors Typora Zettlr n/a Diagram support Markdown and Asciidoc have plugins to support text-based diagram tools such as PlantUML, Mermaid etc. Table 2. Managing documentation sites Stack Markdown/Jekyll Asciidoc/Antora Static site generation Main tools There are several static site generators that support Markdown. Github uses Jekyll by default. Antora is the main site generator for Asciidoc. There don’t seem to be many other options. Multiple repositories and/or versions Additional scripting and templating is needed to generating a single documentation site from multiple repositories or with multiple versions. With Github Pages, a repository can be published as \"subdirectory\" of an organisation-wide site, creating a virtual single documentation site. Antora supports multiple repositories, and adds an abstraction layer of components and versions. Components can be re-used in different target sites. Antora changes the behaviour of some Asciidoc features to enable cross-references and improve portability. Site design and layout Themes and templates There is an abundance of Jekyll templates. Antora basically comes with a single template. Navigation Navigation usually depends on a mixture of document location and metadata in the document that is specific for the template or plugin used. Navigation is based on explicit lists of cross references, and does not depend on particular metadata. Document organisation Structure Jekyll has flexibility in how source documents are organised. The definition of a site is tied to the organisation of its sources. Antora is very opiniated in how sources should be organised. The definition of a site is decoupled from these sources: it is possible to re-use content in multiple sites. Cross references It’s possible to use relative links, but these need to be maintained when reorganising content. Asciidoc and Antora offer cross references that are independent of the location of documents as files. Site deployment Github Pages Github Pages offers a streamlined Markdown and Jekyll by default. It is also possible to add a static site to a repository and publish it via Github Pages (without Jekyll). + With Github Actions, it is possible to use virtually any site generator in combination with Github Pages as part of a GitOps pipeline. Specifics Using a default Markdown and Jekyll setup is the simplest way to generate a site. Antora can work with multiple playbooks to generate and deploy sites, but it takes more work to setup. Table 3. Working with these stacks Stack Markdown/Jekyll Asciidoc/Antora Easy of use Writing documents Markdown is indeed a simple format, and \"real WYSIWYG\" editors like Typora make writing easy. However, as this page demonstrates, I like to work with slightly more sophistcated tables, definition lists, and more. The Asciidoc documentation has a section title \"Graduating to Asciidoc\". It offfers the features I am looking for, but also requires me to more often check with the documentation (or a preview) how to write the markup. Publishing a site Jekyll and Github Pages are the easiest option. It takes some time to understand the Antora model, and decide on how to set it up for yourself. Specifics Github uses its own flavour of Markdown, and also limits the number of plugins that are available. It therefore takes a bit of work to seet up a local environment to \"comply\" with these restrictions and preview the site. It is also possible to use a Github Action tailored to additional needs. Antora overrides some Asciidoc behavious (such as including files outside the content source directory to document code or configuration choices, or relative paths). Antora can work with npm extensions for Asciidoc, but not with Ruby-based extensions. This limits the number of available extensions. As a result, regular editor plugins are not able to show complete previews. Adapting the look and feel Themes There are plenty of themes to choose from. There also is a lot of information available online. There basically is only one template, so anything other than that requires a lot of work. And apart from the Antora documentation, there is not much information availble online. Collaboration Documents Markdown is the easiest format at its core. However, for proper collaboration, it would require additional agreements on the exact flavour to use, and how to work with tables, definition lists, and so on. Smaller edits in Asciidoc are easy, but a contributor will likely need the documentation at hand for anything more elaborate. Asciidoc is being developed as markup standard, and so features are defined in the language and do not need to be standardised separately. Organisation The organisation of a site and the required meta data for documents also needs to be agreed and documented separately. Antora is opiniated in its organisation of content, but it supports re-use and does not have to be standardised separately. Additional options considered: reStructuredText markup is widely used in Python environments, and also in the original IATI documentation. Like Asciidoc, it provides more features to support technical documentation. Since it offers fewer of such features, and does not have a site generator for multiple repositories and versions, I have skipped this for now. Hugo is popular site generator, suitable for Markdown and Asciidoc sites, and very fast. The Xspec project uses it. Since it uses the folder structure of content files to determine the navigation structure, creating a single site from multiple repositories would require the same work as for a Markdown/Jekyll-based site. Zim is a desktop notebook application that makes it very easy to keep notes and write documentation in a true WYSIWYG editor. It supports links, tags, tasks, and a journal-style notebook. It has an export option to export a notebook as either a website or a erStructuredText version. I have also used it as my own notebook since around 2008, so it really works well for me to keep (technical) notes and pointers at hand. However, without the application (available on Linux, with a port made for Windows), it is not really possible to contribute in editing the source. There has been discussion about adding an abstraction layer to let the application work with Asciidoc or another suitable wiki format, but until then it is not an option. The Asciidoc standard is now an Eclipse incubation project Asciidoctor is the main Ruby-based convertor. Antora is a multirepository site generator. The Asciidoctor Kroki extension enables text-based diagrams conversion with a Kroki service. The Eclipse Asciidoc plugin helps writing in Eclipse. 1.Mona Bärenfänger.

Robust standards like DocBook and DITA are XML-based, and require particular editors. They also require a lot more learning to be able to use them well.

Semantic diagrams Diagrams in documentation usually specify a structure or behaviour. The source of diagrams therefore describes concepts and relations, rather than forms and shapes. Diagrams as text stimulates using Diagram standards. Diagrams and source code Diagrams as text can be included as documentation in source code, or be generated from sources. In stricter situations, source code could also be generated from specifications in diagrams, but this is not considered important in this stack. Layout control trade-off Most diagram rendering engines offer very limited control over layout. Styling can also be difficult, and keeping the style consistent with the rest of the documentation requires additional work. There are two popular approaches to diagrams as text rendering engines. Generate images in a compile stage when producing a static website, and include (links to) these images in the pages. This approach often uses GraphViz as part of the stack, to do layout. There are many diagram syntaxes, for various domains. A popular tool is PlantUML. Include a Javascript library to render images in the browser after a page is loaded. This approach usually replaces the diagram text and embeds SVG in a page. The SVG image can use stylesheet information. A popular tool is MermaidJS (which also can compile static images). The first approach is older, and there seem to be a wider choice of tools to write diagram text. Kroki is an image processing tool and service that makes many different rendering engines available via a uniform API. Kroki supports both PlantUML and MermaidJS. Kroki is available as an online service. It can also be run as local stand-alone service, although that takes some effort to set up. Antora can use the asciidoctor-kroki module to convert diagram text in a page into an image. This keeps the choice of diagram tool flexible. UML is actually a modeling language. In its full form, it lets you write a model for a system, and produce different graphical views of this model. UML provides a rich set of diagrams for both structural and behavioural documentation of a software system. These diagrams provide a highly standardised visual notation for the concepts in the model. PlantUML supports drawing visual UML diagrams from textual descriptions, using its own syntax. It does not offer any support for conceptual modeling itself. This is sufficient for the documentation I do. It is easy to write up a sufficiently detailed diagram to explain an approach. It is also possible to include PlantUML documentation in a source file, and produce a diagram from that. This makes keeping sources and documentation synchronised easier. The specific notation of UML makes it harder to use in more general overviews and high-level descriptions. The C4 Model was developed to bridge the gap between the detailed UML standard, and informal diagrams without any standardised semantics. It offers four levels of abstraction (context, container, component, code, hence C4). although it recommendeds only using the first three levels [1]. In its full form, using a tool like Structurizr, it can also capture a model, and generate different diagrams as views of that model. C4 limits itself to structural views, and actively promotes the use of additional diagram and model techniques to provide more context or detail. PlantUML also supports drawing C4 diagrams, using its own syntax. Structurizr has an open source commandline tool that can generate PlantUML descriptions from C4 models. Rendering Structurizr diagrams directly can only be done via the online service. Both UML and C4 provide description languages as well as diagram notations. PlantUML can draw diagrams that follow the diagram notation standards, but uses its own description languages for the specification. This is fine for the documentation I do, but does lock those diagrams to PlantUML specifically. There are additional diagram types that may be included as \"standards\" in the future. Flowcharts Gantt charts Work breakdown structures PlantUML supports UML, WBS, C4, and more. The C4 model is part of PlantUML’s standard library. Kroki provides a unified API for PlantUML and other visualisation tools. 1.Simon Brown. Visualising software architecture with the C4 model. 16-Aug-2019.

This makes it possible to explain an approach or decision with more context, while keeping the details in the implementation files. This will make it easier to maintain consistency and reduce duplication. To do this, we use Asciidoc tags in the code to specify sections to include in the documentation. In addition, callout texts can be added as comment block in the code. Antora first copies files in the specified docs folder into a virtual file system. It then processes those copied files. Therefore, it is not possible to use relative paths to files outside the docs folder: those locations are not accessible from the virtual file system. However, it is possible to create symlinks in the examples folder to source files in the repository. These symlinked files will be read and copied during the content collection phase. Files with names that start with ., or that have no filename extension, are not collected or processed by Antora. Therefore, the names of symlinks need to be adapted for those files. As an example, here is a how to add a portion of a script to a documentation page. Add comments in the script to tag the section that is going to be included in the documentation. [1] We use a second section with a separate tag to capture callout notes that should also go into the documentation. In the script to be documented # script example #... (first part of the script, not included in the documentation) ... # tag::aliases[] (1) alias mv='mv -i' # (2) alias cp='cp -i' # (3) : 'end::aliases[] (4) tag::aliases-notes[] (5) This is the callout for the first `alias` command. And this for the second. ' # end::aliases-notes[] (6) # ... (rest of the script, not included in the documentation) ... 1 Open a tag aliases for the script portion to be included in the documentation. 2 Add # at the end of one line to create the first callout. 3 Add # at the end of another line to create the second callout. 4 Start a multi-line comment using : ', and close the tag for the script portion. 5 Open another tag aliases-notes for the callouts, and add the text for them. 6 End the multi-line comment (with :) and close the tag for the callouts text. Instead of numbered callouts , , it is also possible to use . This will automatically number the callouts. However, using explicit numbering will make the comments easier to read and verify references in the script itself. Use the include macro of Asciidoc to first import the tagged source section as code block. Then include the notes section directly following the source block, to add the callout notes. In the documentation source Start of the documentation page ... [source, zsh] .My documented script ---- include::../examples/my-documented-script.zsh[tags=aliases] (1) ---- include::../examples/my-documented-script.zsh[tags=aliases-notes] (2) Rest of the documentation page ... 1 Include the script portion in a code block. 2 Include the callouts text as regular Asciidoc after the code block.

This section attempts to offer guidance on when to use specific elements. The Asciidoc documentation does explain the difference between Caution and Warning. We expand on that, inspired by other documentation guidelines. Neutral information Use a NOTE to inform the reader of something even when skimming a page. Positive consequences Negative consequences Use a TIP to help a reader benefit from potential added value, or to explore a new direction. Use a CAUTION note to advise the reader to act carefully (i.e., exercise care), to avoid errors or mistakes. Use an IMPORTANT note to share crucial information for the reader to be succesful. Use a WARNING to inform the reader of danger, harm, or severe consequences that exist. Asciidoc’s admonitions documentation Microsoft’s alerts overview Logging levels and feedback message types.

Example: the primary node uses a stereotype, the others plain colours skinparam participant> { $node_1_style(1) } participant \"Primary node\" > participant \"Secondary node\" $node_2_main_color participant \"Logic element\" $logic_main_color participant \"Grouping element\" $group_main_color participant \"Divider element\" $divider_main_color participant \"Note\" $note_main_color The admonition colors are also included, to make it easy to use them in diagrams as well. Figure 3. Using admonition colors for elements Source for the example above hide footbox participant tip > note over tip $tip_color: Tip participant note > / note over note $note_color: Note participant warning > / note over warning $warning_color: Warning participant caution > / note over caution $caution_color: Caution participant important > / note over important $important_color: Important The Kroki server that generates PlantUML diagrams has an option to include the PlantUML configuration file.
